        <h3>About the role</h3>
        <p>Community care is a pivotal part of our healthcare system, and covers a diverse range of care settings such as nursing homes, senior care centres, community hospitals, and hospices. Seniors cared for in these settings will require more support especially amidst COVID-19, and we need a resilient community care workforce to care for them.</p>
        <p>With training, individuals with an interest in caring for the elderly - with or without healthcare experience - can support care in the community through these roles:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Community Care Ambassadors</strong> support basic care and activities within nursing homes or senior care centres in collaboration with care staff.</li>
          <li><strong>Healthcare Assistants</strong> work as part of the regular care team to deliver basic to intermediate care for seniors with more complex care needs.</li>
        </ul>

        
 

        <h3>Training and commitment</h3>
        <p>Training will be provided to prepare you for work and volunteer roles in the community. These include e-learning and in-person modules in:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Basic care</strong> - supporting seniors in activities of daily living, and monitoring of vital signs</li>
          <li><strong>Mobility assistance</strong> - techniques in lifting and transferring seniors, falls prevention</li>
          <li><strong>Communication and Engagement</strong> - engaging seniors in social and recreational activities</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Training will be conducted by our training partners, and will be fully funded by the SG Healthcare
        Corps. Interested individuals should be able to commit to the full training duration:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Community Care Ambassador - 5 days (or 3 days for former nurses)</li>
          <li>Healthcare Assistant - 17 days, with on-the-job training thereafter</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Enlistees who have completed training will standby for activation (i.e. agree to being contacted by healthcare institutions) for at least 3 months.</p>


        <h3>Post-training deployment</h3>
        <p>If you have completed training, you will be qualified to work or volunteer in community care for roles you received training in. We will do a best match based on your expressed preferences, availability, and available opportunities. If there is a good match and you are activated for deployment, you will be remunerated for your time and contribution. Part-time and full-time work opportunities are both available.</p>

          Joining the Singapore Healthcare Corps - FAQ
        </div>
      </h2>
      <div class="container narrow">
        <h3 class="question">Who can join?</h3>
        <p>While caregiving experience is relevant, we welcome individuals with or without healthcare background to join us. Please indicate your interest via the forms on the respective links, and ensure that you can commit to the full training duration. Do note that you must be aged 18 years old and above to be considered for training and roles.</p>
        <h3 class="question">How and where will I serve, if I am activated?</h3>
        <p>With the support of the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC), you will be matched to a community care organisation providing care for seniors in settings such as nursing homes or senior care centres. Most of these organisations offer full-time or part-time work opportunities, or volunteer roles. As part of your training, you will receive on-the-job training in some of these organisations - you may consider staying on to serve with them, or secure a match with another organisation recommended by AIC. As your training is fully funded, enlistees are expected to serve for at least 3 months with a community care organisation post-training.</p>
        <h3 class="question">Will I require additional insurance or indemnity to support COVID-19 efforts?</h3>
        <p>Your safety is our priority. You will be working alongside care teams in the community care organisations you are matched to, who will put in place precautionary measures and training to ensure workplace safety and health. On your part, please note to only serve if you are well, i.e. have no flu-like symptoms such as fever and cough, and do not have long-term health conditions that put you at increased risk of COVID-19 or other illnesses.</p>
        <p>To the extent not covered by any existing insurance, indemnity, or compensation schemes, the Government of the Republic of Singapore will indemnify anything done or omitted to be done in good faith and with reasonable care by all medical practitioners and healthcare workers, in the discharge of their functions and duties in efforts to prevent and reduce the spread of COVID-19.</p>
        <h3 class="question">I've signed up via one of the forms. What's next?</h3>
        <p>Thank you for your interest in joining the SG Healthcare Corps! If you have signed up, you will be invited to join our outreach channels to receive the latest updates. If there is a good match, we will be in touch with you via email or phone call to confirm your enlistment and training placement. After you have completed training, we will also do a best match with the institution that can benefit from your help. Stay tuned, share this opportunity to #standby4SG, and keep well.</p>
