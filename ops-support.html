        <h3>About the role</h3>
        <p><strong>Operations Support Staff</strong> support our healthcare professionals in operations across COVID-19 related operations, such as community isolation facilities, dormitory operations, hospitals, and community care settings. Individuals may be deployed to support healthcare professionals in one of these tasks:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Swabs</strong> - support clinical tests and diagnosis through the nasopharyngeal swab procedure (training provided) </li>
          <li><strong>Phlebotomy</strong> - support clinical tests and diagnosis through the venipuncture procedure (training provided)</li>
          <li><strong>Admin and Ops</strong> - support ground operations (e.g. registration, assist in moving supplies) and compliance with health monitoring</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Training and commitment</h3>

        <p>Training will be provided to prepare you for the operations you may be deployed to - these include e- learning modules in infection control, and in-person training in one of two specialised skills: (i) nasopharyngeal swab procedure; (ii) phlebotomy.</p>
        <p>Training will be conducted by our training partners, and will be fully funded by the SG Healthcare Corps. Training duration will be between 1-3 days, and enlistees who have completed training will standby for activation (i.e. agree to being contacted by healthcare institutions).</p>

        <h3>Post-training deployment</h3>
        <p>If you have completed training, you will be qualified to work as a Healthcare Operations Support Staff at ground operations. We will do a best match based on your expressed preferences, availability, and available opportunities. If there is a good match and you are activated for deployment, you will be remunerated for your time and contribution. Part-time and full-time opportunities are both available.</p>

          Joining the Singapore Healthcare Corps - FAQ
        </div>
      </h2>
      <div class="container narrow">
        <h3 class="question">Who can join?</h3>
        <p>We welcome individuals with or without healthcare background to join the Corps as a Healthcare Operations Support Staff. To be considered for training, you will need a minimum qualification of GCE 'N' Level (with pass in English) or WPLN Level 6. Please indicate your interest via the forms on the respective links, and do note that you must be aged 18 years old and above to be considered for roles.</p>
        <h3 class="question">How and where will I serve, if I am activated?</h3>
        <p>You may be called upon to serve if there is a good match with available opportunities. Sites where opportunities may arise include public healthcare, community care, primary care institutions, community isolation facilities, and swab isolation facilities. You will support our healthcare workforce in delivering care and assurance to patients in need - this is not just about directly supporting our COVID-19 response, as we have healthcare professionals in care settings such as community hospitals and nursing homes, where support may also be needed.</p>
        <h3 class="question">Will I require additional insurance or indemnity to support COVID-19 efforts?</h3>
        <p>Your safety is our priority. You will be supported by the institutions you are matched to, who will put in place precautionary measures and training to ensure workplace safety and health. On your part, please note to only serve if you are well, i.e. have no flu-like symptoms such as fever and cough, and do not have long-term health conditions that put you at increased risk of COVID- 19 or other illnesses.</p>
        <p>To the extent not covered by any existing insurance, indemnity, or compensation schemes, the Government of the Republic of Singapore will indemnify anything done or omitted to be done in good faith and with reasonable care by all medical practitioners and healthcare workers, in the discharge of their functions and duties in efforts to prevent and reduce the spread of COVID-19.</p>
        <h3 class="question">I've signed up via one of the forms. What's next?</h3>
        <p>Thank you for your interest in joining the SG Healthcare Corps! If you have signed up, you will be invited to join our outreach channels to receive the latest updates. If there is a good match, we will be in touch with you via email or phone call to confirm your enlistment and training placement. After you have completed training, we will also do a best match with the institution that can benefit from your help. Stay tuned, share this opportunity to #standby4SG, and keep well.</p>
