          Joining the SG Healthcare Corps - FAQs
        </div>
      </h2>
      <div class="container narrow">
        <h3 class="question">Why has the SG Healthcare Corps been formed?</h3>
        <p>The SG Healthcare Corps is intended to provide support to our healthcare and community care professionals by referring additional healthcare professionals and lay extenders to areas of need. It is currently coordinated by the Ministry of Health, with support from our partner agencies, as well as institutions from public healthcare, primary, and community care sectors.</p>
        <h3 class="question">Who can join?</h3>
        <p>We welcome former and currently practising healthcare professionals interested in returning to serve in public healthcare and community care, as well as non-healthcare professionals committed to training in supporting roles. Please indicate your interest via the forms on the respective links, and do note that you must be aged 18 years old and above to be considered for roles.</p>
        <h3 class="question">How and where will I serve, if I am activated?</h3>
        <p>You may be called upon to serve if there is a good match with available opportunities. Sites where opportunities may arise include public healthcare, community care, and primary care institutions. Some of our enlistees have also been deployed to COVID-19 operations such as community isolation facilities, swab isolation facilities, and at foreign worker dormitories. You will support our healthcare workforce in delivering care and assurance to patients in need - this is not just about directly supporting our COVID-19 response, as we have healthcare professionals in care settings such as community hospitals and nursing homes, where support may also be needed.</p>
        <h3 class="question">Will I require additional insurance or indemnity to support COVID-19 efforts?</h3>
        <p>Your safety is our priority. You will be supported by the institutions you are matched to, who will put in place precautionary measures and training to ensure workplace safety and health. On your part, please note to only serve if you are well, i.e. have no flu-like symptoms such as fever and cough, and do not have long-term health conditions that put you at increased risk of COVID-19 or other illnesses.</p>
        <p>To the extent not covered by any existing insurance, indemnity, or compensation schemes, the Government of the Republic of Singapore will indemnify anything done or omitted to be done in good faith and with reasonable care by all medical practitioners and healthcare workers, in the discharge of their functions and duties in efforts to prevent and reduce the spread of COVID-19.</p>
        <h3 class="question">I've signed up via one of the forms. What's next?</h3>
        <p>Thank you for your interest in joining the SG Healthcare Corps! If you have signed up, you will be invited to join our outreach channels to receive the latest updates. If there is a good match, we will be in touch with you via email or phone call to confirm your enlistment to the Corps, and to link you up with the institution that can benefit from your help. Stay tuned, share this opportunity to #standby4SG, and keep well.</p>
